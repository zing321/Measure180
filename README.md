Measure180
==========

app for measuring distances and heights on windows phone


Code is all in MainPage.xaml.cs.

If anyone would like to opimize the code go for it but it works as it is now. 

Problems:
-I can not seem to figure out how to get the roll angle right for landscape mode so I have it disabled. For pitch the angles go from 0 to 180 and -180 to 0, easy right? For roll the angles go from 0 to 90 then 90 to 0 then 0 to -90 and -90 to 0. I have no idea how to diffrentiate 0 to 90 from 90 to 0
